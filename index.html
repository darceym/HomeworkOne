    <p>Hi, I'm Darcey! Originally hailing from the great state of Wisconsin, I've basically grown up in Charlotte, NC. I attended the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and majored in History and Geography. I have a background in GIS, and will absolutely freak out over a well designed map.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am currently back at school at UNC-Charlotte to study full stack web development. I am excited for this challenge and the opportunity to change careers.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy skiing, sporting clays, reading, traveling and spending time with my family.</p>
